Smart Home Automation for Energy Optimization

Smart home automation transforms energy management from a manual chore into an intelligent, automated system. Properly configured automation can reduce energy consumption by 15-25% without sacrificing comfort.

Scheduling and Time-Based Automation:
- Program devices to operate during off-peak electricity hours (typically 10 PM to 6 AM). This includes dishwashers, washing machines, dryers, and EV chargers.
- Set water heaters to pre-heat during off-peak hours and maintain temperature during peak hours without actively heating. A well-insulated tank loses only 1-2°F per hour.
- Schedule pool pumps to run during solar generation hours (10 AM to 3 PM) when you have solar panels, or during off-peak hours if you don't.
- Use smart plugs to automatically turn off entertainment centers, gaming consoles, and computer peripherals during sleeping hours, eliminating phantom loads that cost $100-$200 per year.

Presence Detection and Occupancy-Based Control:
- Use motion sensors, geofencing, and smart home presence detection to automatically adjust HVAC when nobody is home. Geofencing can trigger "away" mode when all household members leave a defined radius.
- Smart lighting systems with occupancy sensors can reduce lighting energy by 30-50% by automatically turning off lights in unoccupied rooms.
- Configure your smart home hub to enter "vacation mode" when extended absence is detected, reducing HVAC to minimum maintenance levels and turning off non-essential devices.
- Door and window sensors can pause HVAC when windows are opened, preventing the system from trying to condition outdoor air.

Integration Between Devices:
- Connect your solar inverter to your smart home system to automatically route excess solar generation to battery storage, EV charging, or water heating.
- Link weather forecast data to your HVAC schedule. If a cool evening is predicted, the system can begin pre-cooling the house using outside air instead of running the compressor.
- Integrate electricity pricing feeds to automatically shift flexible loads to the cheapest hours. Smart EV chargers can pause charging during demand response events and resume when prices drop.
- Create scenes like "Good Night" that simultaneously lock doors, set back thermostats, turn off lights, and enable overnight EV charging.

Energy Monitoring and Feedback:
- Install whole-home energy monitors (like Sense or Emporia Vue) to track real-time consumption by device. Awareness alone typically reduces consumption by 5-10%.
- Set up daily or weekly energy reports sent to your phone. Track trends and identify unusual spikes that may indicate equipment problems.
- Configure alerts for abnormal consumption patterns, such as HVAC running continuously or appliances consuming power during expected off periods.
- Use energy dashboards to compare month-over-month usage and set household energy reduction goals.

Voice Control and Convenience:
- Voice assistants can provide quick energy status updates: "How much energy did I use today?" or "What's my current solar generation?"
- Set up voice-triggered routines like "I'm leaving" that automatically optimize the home for unoccupied mode.
- Use voice commands to check electricity prices before starting high-consumption devices: "Is it a good time to run the dryer?"
